MDE Exclusion Checker is a project I began to help customers review their current AV exclusion settings and start to trim the list based on the default exclusions included in Defender Anti-Virus.

For more details check out the [help page](./help.md).

This project is still being worked on, and has been an interesting area for me to experiment and grow some solutions and skills.
