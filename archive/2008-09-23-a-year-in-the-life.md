I'm coming around on my one year anniversary with MicroLink and in honor of that I decided I would talk about how I got to MicroLink, the company itself and the work I have been doing for the past year.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

**My Departure and Arrival**

A little over a year ago now the company I was working for announce it had lost the contract I was working on to Lockheed Martin. This was a stunning blow to the company because it was our largest contract at the time, and as far as we knew our performance on the contract had been more than satisfactory.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

We received word a few weeks later that our company had begun a protest and everything, interviews/communication with Lockheed came to a screeching halt, which just lead to greater anxiety about the turnover. I had already contacted and been interviewed by MicroLink and several other companies about working with them while this continued and finally had completed negotiation of a contract with MicroLink.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

Finally, I made my decision to accept MicroLink's offer still hopeful that I would have an opportunity to get back to KnIFE even though I was leaving. The day I sent my acceptance letter to MicroLink my boss told us that we had lost the first appeal, but were appealing another contract award point. I told him my decision in private, and he was very gracious and congratulated me. The next week the other two KnIFE developers announced their decision to leave as well, one followed me to MicroLink.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

Two weeks later, I was a MicroLink employee. By December, my old company announced it had lost the appeals, and by January/February Lockheed Martin was in charge.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

**Me at MicroLink**

The first project I was assigned to at MicroLink, and one that I'm still involved in today, was HARMONIEWeb. This project is an attempt to bridge the communication gap between DoD and Non-Government Organizations, including foreign countries. I have worked on numerous pieces of HARMONIEWeb, account registration, lost password, mapping and imagery, adobe connect, and have really enjoyed the unique tasks. This being said I'm pretty sure I'm cursed, seems like very time I'm working on a piece of the project I discover a problem with Microsoft or Adobe code that we either have to develop a work around for, because they don't have one, or we have to wait for a patch.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

I have, as I hoped, been able to go back to KnIFE on occasion to assist in deploying items to their systems. I have written a few blogs about ECTS in which my experiences deploying at KnIFE have been the basis for the information. Recently this work has lead to additional work for the JCREW, a Jamming/Counter IED group, where I have been able to migrate users from a DotNetNuke platform to a MOSS platform.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

I have also been able to work on projects internal to MicroLink, specifically on Virtual Earth - Mapping and Imagery concepts. Although my work on HARMONIEWeb, KnIFE, and JCREW have demanded much of my time I have really enjoyed working on the Virtual Earth capabilities and incorporating them into SharePoint.

**My personal perspective on MicroLink**

Over the past year I can honestly say I have never once been bored while working for MicroLink, frustrated (with my code not the company)â€¦yes, but never bored. I have one of the best commutes, walk down the hall to my office, and resources that only Microsoft could rival. I have had the opportunity to work on everything from Network Infrastructure to web parts. I have been challenged to do a lot for the company, sometimes working three projects at once, but I have also been fairly compensated for those "above-and-beyond" hours.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

I can also say that MicroLink has not yet allowed me to go naked, I receive some company attire just about every quarter. I have also been made to feel as though I'm a valuable resource to MicroLink, that while we continue to grow the opportunities for me to lead have grown, and the opportunities for me to learn have grown.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

So I reached my goal this year, one company for at least a year, here is to what I hope will be another successful year at MicroLink.
