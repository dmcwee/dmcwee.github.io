Iâ€™m a Technology Solutions Professional at Microsoft who specializes in Identity and Information Protection.  I currently support organizations who are looking to improve the security of their Identities and Information as they move from an On-Premise world to a distributed and cloud centric IT environment.

I began working on SharePoint platforms in early 2006, and began to specialize in Identity to support access to portals from by external users and organizations.  I have implemented Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), Azure Active Directory Integration, and more recently OAuth implementations to support distributed authentication providers.  Today, I work on Azure Active Directory and Enterprise Mobility + Security Proofs-of-Concept and Pilots.

My career has spanned a variety of environments from Public Sector to Private Sector, and from Mainframes to Desktops to Mobile Devices.
