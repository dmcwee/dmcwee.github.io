title: Labs
---

These pages include information about the labs I've created and use on a regular basis. The repository is free for you to use/borrow/fork as you see fit, but I make no promises or guarantees if you rely on these about updates, releases, etc.

## Basics

There are two primary labs I use: [MDELab](./mde) and [MDILab](./mdi). Both labs can be deployed temporarily or deployed and used for a longer period of time. 

### MDE Lab

[MDE Lab](./mde) is based on running VMs for about a year in Azure while I've experimented, tested, and learned capabilities in MDE. Over a year, or more, I've created and deleted VMS, enrolled and unenrolled them in MDE, added varying types of OS's, and even experimented with various management platforms (Intune, Ansible, SaltStack, etc.). This environment is a collection of those artifacts so I can create and tear down these labs for various purposes.

### MDI Lab

[MDI Lab](./mdi) based on the Defender for Identity [Security Alert Lab](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/playbook-lab-overview) as specified in the [Lab Setup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/playbook-setup-lab), and is intended to get the VMs configured as close as I've been able to get them automatically including naming, IP addresses, and even AD Users and Group/Group Memberships.
