I decided to try and take a quick look at Windows Azure and see where Microsoft was with its cloud computing/services models. Unfortunately I found the supported systems to be limited to Vista (SP1) and Windows Server 2008. Since my current development machine is only Windows Server 2003 R2 I guess this will just have to wait until I have time to get back to Windows 2008.
