A partner company, [IDVSolutions](http://www.idvsolutions.com/), is preparing a webcast to demonstrate their Geospatial SharePoint ready web parts.&nbsp; I have been working with IDV for almost 1 year now, and I have had a lot of success extending their suite of tools to meet customer capabilities.&nbsp; If you have the time make sure you [sign up](http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032373601&Culture=en-US) and join the webcast, if you don't have time at least take a look at their [Wonders of the World](http://wondersoftheworld.idvsolutions.com/) demo site.
