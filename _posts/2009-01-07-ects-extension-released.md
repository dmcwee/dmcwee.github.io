I am happy to announce the release of our [ECTS Extensions to CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/ectsex). This extension provides a bit of a performance boost especially to the User Management capability in ECTS.  
ECTS provides a forms based authentication schema for SharePoint that leverages ADAM so you can allow external people access to your SharePoint to enable collaboration. With these extensions you can now allow external users to request accounts as well as manage the accounts in a more friendly UI.
