I recently had a request for a more detailed example of how to use the Azure Mobile Angular Services so I went ahead and created a single page application that has very little capability but is a good example for those getting started with AngularJS and Azure Mobile Angular Services and have pushed it to the [GitHub](https://github.com/dmcwee/azuremobileangularservices) site. The example is built using Visual Studio but is just a single HTML page and a Scripts folder with the necessary .js files inside.Once you have pulled the project you will find it does actually read from my Azure Mobile Services, although write is disabled,so you can follow along.
