I recently had a request for a more detailed example of how to use the Azure Mobile Angular Services so I went ahead and created a single page application that has very little capability but is a good example for those getting started with AngularJS and Azure Mobile Angular Services and have pushed it to the [GitHub](https://github.com/dmcwee/azuremobileangularservices) site.&nbsp; The example is built using Visual Studio but is just a single HTML page and a Scripts folder with the necessary .js files inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you have pulled the project you will find it does actually read from my Azure Mobile Services, although write is disabled,&nbsp;so you can follow along.
