Recently I was contacted by PACKT Publishing because they have recently published a book **Microsoft Silverlight 4 and SharePoint 2010 Integration** and wanted me to review the book.&nbsp; I’m actually quite excited about this opportunity because it is my first invitation to review a book, and the book is talking about two of my favorite technologies!

Currently I have a deadline approaching for a SharePoint 2007 Farm Architecture document, my least favorite thing to do, so I’m not allowing myself a lot of time with “fun” stuff like the topics in this book until the documentation is complete.&nbsp; However, I have reviewed the first chapter and I really can’t wait to get back to it.&nbsp; The first chapter is a very straight forward approach to creating a Silverlight Application and then including it in SharePoint 2010.

PACKT has published the first chapter “Integrating Silverlight 4 with SharePoint 2010” [here](https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/0066-chapter-1-integrating-silverlight-4-with-share-point .pdf) for others to read before purchasing the book.

Once I have gotten through my documentation work I will take the time to review the book, try the examples, and will then post more about it here on my blog.
