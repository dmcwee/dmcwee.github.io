I've decided to really document and push my Azure Labs so anyone can easily deploy environments for use with testing and learning the various Microsoft Defender products. This labs have been available for a while, but I've now committed some time to documenting and incorporating that information as part of [this site](/labs/).
<!--more-->

Over time my plan is to add more deployment groups, add learning scenarios, and what ever else I've found useful in helping me learn the Defender Suite.  My hope is that other will find this information helpful and use these labs to learn, test, trial these products and solutions.

If you find any issues please submit them using the GitHub Repo reporting capabilities and I'll do my best to fix them quickly.
