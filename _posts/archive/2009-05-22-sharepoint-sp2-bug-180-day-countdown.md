Microsoft recently released the latest service pack for SharePoint 2007 (SP2) which does provide a number of enhancements.&nbsp; However, in their process of developing this Service Pack they happened to overlook the fact that SP2 resets your SharePoint Installation into a Trial Mode.&nbsp; What does this mean, basically you have 180 days after installing SP2 to reactivate your SharePoint install as a non-trial version or your SharePoint instance will stop working.&nbsp; Currently there are no automatic hot fixes for this, but you can re-enter your Product ID on the Convert License Type page which will resolve this issue.

[Here is the official statement on the SharePoint blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/sharepoint/archive/2009/05/21/attention-important-information-on-service-pack-2.aspx).
