You may have noticed that the site look and feel has changed.&nbsp; I felt it was about time to get a new theme on the blog since much has recently changed.&nbsp; For those that didn't know I began working directly for Microsoft at the end of June 2015.&nbsp; As I continue to grow professionally I have decided it is time for&nbsp;me to spend a greater amount of time focusing on Identity and to begin to move away from my focus in SharePoint.

The wonderful thing about identity is that I won't actually leave SharePoint, but now my focus will be on WHO is accessing the portal.&nbsp; I also get the opportunity to expand my technology base into Skype for Business, CRM, Mobile Apps, basically any and every technology you can think of.&nbsp; I'm excited about this change and I hope to share lots of new information with everyone.

As always, come back often and if you have questions always reach out.
