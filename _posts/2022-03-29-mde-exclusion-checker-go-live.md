MDE Exclusion Checker is a tool to compare existing AV Exclusions against the list of exclusions that are native to Defender for Endpoint AntiVirus, and is now live!

## Migrating to Defender AV
Migrating from one AV provider to another can be a pain and often includes significant administrative overhead as the need to review exclusions, configurations, etc. all demand human time and commitment.

## About MDE Exclusion Checker
MDE Exclusion Checker is an Excel Add-In that you can add to Microsoft Excel in the web or locally. This tool reviews the selected list of AV Exclusion paths and files against the published list of native exclusions in MDE found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-server-exclusions-microsoft-defender-antivirus?view=o365-worldwide#automatic-exclusions-on-windows-server-2016-or-later).
