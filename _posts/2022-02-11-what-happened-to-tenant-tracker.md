Looking for [Tenant Tracker](/tenant-tracker) tool?  It's still here (the link is in the top navigation left of my name), but this is site is transitioning to the home for my blog. Hopefully, if you liked the tool you'll find some useful content here too.

## What's Happening Here?
Over time you will notice formatting changes and enhancements made here as I clean up the styles and get better with Jekyll and GitPages.  I apologise if you find broken link or if everything isn't working 100% as I make this transition from WordPress to GitHub Pages. If you notice any issues with the site please don't hesitate to reach out!
