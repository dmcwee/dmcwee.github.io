    <h3>How to Fix the SharePoint Modified Date to use Date and Time</h3>

    </p>
    <p><p>If you’ve started using SharePoint 2013 you probably noticed that Microsoft changed the way they present the Modified value. In SharePoint 2010 the Modified field showed a Date/Time stamp, but in SharePoint 2013 the Date/Time is replaced with something like “3 minutes ago”. Personally I like this, but some users may not and the Date/Time stamp may be really important especially for Legal Departments or other Audited applications.</p>

<p>Fortunately there is a very simple fix, using the Client Side Rendering to override SharePoint’s default rendering of the Modified field.</p>

    <p><p>I’ve been working on a site migration from SharePoint 2010 to SharePoint 2013 and a lot of what we did in 2010 was to customize forms the user interacts with. One of the requirements we had was to ensure a Project Name and Project Alias field did not contain the same information. In SharePoint 2010 this had been done by adding some JavaScript to the page, grabbing each control by HTML Element ID, and then comparing their values. When we migrated these fields all got new HTML Element IDs so our validation logic was broken.</p>

    <p><p>I recently had more fun with setting Managed Metadata values in SharePoint 2010. This time as part of an event receiver during the Item Adding, Item Updating, and Item Updated events. (There are interesting event ordering challenges which lead to using all of these events, but that is not the focus of this blog.) The challenge I faced was copying values from a Document Set down to documents that were being created/uploaded to the list. Normally, using Shared Properties would negate this but because we wanted use to edit the Managed Metadata Values in the Document Information Panel we could not use shared values because the Document Set would immediately overwrite any changes made to the document. Instead we created an Event Receiver to manually handle the updates from the Document to the Document Set, and from the Document Set to the child documents.</p>

    <p><p>I’ve been working on a project recently that has a large number of sub-agencies and the parent organization was attempting to push a standardization of Content Types. Since no one really wanted to duplicate work the organization decided they did not want to migrate content into SharePoint (from file shares) until all the content types and metadata had been identified and created. However, as with all large agencies some groups wanted to move forward with limited or partial capabilities because after all some limited capability is better than what they currently have. The concern that arose from this was: What if they created a Content Type in one of their Site Collections that had the same name as one that would be published later on?</p>

Unless I have been working with a standard list type, I generally create a Content Type that my workflow can be associated with and to ensure the columns and values needed in the workflow will be present. However, creating Content Types is always a painful process, because as you develop the content types and test them you need to delete the original content type, and any list depended up in before you deploy the updated version. This is even worse when you upgrade a solution that is in use in productionbecause you can’t easily delete the content type just to add additional fields.</p>

While we were testing the site we noticed that my browser was running inBrowser ModeIE10 with Document Standard IE 7 Standard,but his was running Browser Mode IE 10 with Document Mode: Standards. Having battled with SharePoint 2010using anHTML5 Masterpage I began looking for the Meta tag on the page which should define the appropriate browser mode and noticed he had removed it. I had him add the tag back to the masterpage (from my experience removing the browser mode tag in SP2010 causes all kinds of issues when editing pages, list items, etc) but still found the dashboard was not functioning properly.</p>

The charity didn’t want to have to create new active directory accounts for each of these volunteers so as part of the demo we integrated SharePoint 2010 site with Windows Azure App Fabric Access Control (ACS), this way we could use Google, Windows Live, and Yahoo! as authentication providers. (Yes I know we could hook directly to each of these providers, but using ACS allowed me to use all the providers with one SharePoint Trusted Provider instead of using three different trust providers). We demoed the site to the charity and they were very excited and happy with the solution.</p>

    <p><p>Many SharePoint developers have come from a background with ASP.NET and so most are familiar with the Membership Provider concept. SharePoint uses ASP.NET at its core the membership providers you have build for custom web applications can be used in your SharePoint web application. The advantage of this is that you can abstract your web parts, application pages, etc in SharePoint so they use the Membership Provider to get user information rather than coding your own Active Directory calls into a library or the web part/application page itself.</p>

    <p><p>During a recent project I was leveraging the SharePoint Lists Web Service to retrieve information from a list and push it to a Silverlight display. The list I was using was a heavily customized list with about 35 different views and at least as may fields. My Silverlight display would provide information like the “status” of the list item based on a number of other criteria. This status field was stored as a simple “Single line of text” field in the SharePoint list.</p>
